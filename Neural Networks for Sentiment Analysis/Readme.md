# Overview
implement two different neural networks for sentiment analysis: **1. Feedforward Neural Networks**, **2. Bi-directional LSTM**.

I used two different dimentional sizes for each of models: 300 dimentional emmdeding matrix and 50 dimentional emmdeding matrix

# Result
### Accuracy on Test
Feedforward50 : 78.1%, Feedforward300 : 79.9%

Bidirectional LSTM50 : 78.3%, Bidirectional LSTM300 : 81.8%
